# dogecommands
Powershell and Bash doge commands

**Commands**

`wow`: generates a doge with phrases in random places  
`doge`: shows two phrases, then doge, then wow (Powershell only) 
Both commands can use `-hyper` to go faster and/or a number to specify the number of doge.  
The two commands can be installed in Powershell by running `installDoge.ps1`.  
This may require running:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
to fully work.

Add an alias in Bash for wow.sh

Bash can also use `-warp` to go as fast as your computer lets you
