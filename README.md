Powershell doge commands

**Commands**

`wow`: generates a doge with phrases in random places  
`doge`: shows two phrases, then doge, then wow  
Both commands can use `-hyper` to go faster and/or a number to specify the number of doge.  
The two commands can be installed by running `installDoge.ps1`.  
This may require running:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
to fully work.
